# My Docker-Compose Templates
I have 4 Raspberry Pi Model 4Bs, One Pi Zero 2 W and one Orange Pi Zero 3B 4B which I primarily use to run some services in my homelab. I also have 3 AMD Servers with Ryzen 1600, 5600X and Athlon 3000 for various purposes.

Howevwe becuase of power consumption concerns I prefer to use my ARM based SBC rather than AMD Servers. So most of my Docker-Compose files will be able to run on ARM based devices.

Each ***Docker-Compose file has comments*** for nuances and specific Environment Variable, but below you can also find some common pitfalls and specific instructions that would come handy.
